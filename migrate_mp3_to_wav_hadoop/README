HOW TO
The migrate-mp3-to-wav-hadoop module creates two hadoop jobs. The first job MigrateMp3ToWav, which does the
actual migration and the ffprobe characterisation of the mp3 files.

The input to the job is a list of mp3 file paths to mp3 files already available on HDFS. The text file with
the list of mp3 file paths should also be available on HDFS.

To run the job first run 'mvn package' to get 'migrate_mp3_to_wav_hadoop-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar'

Then run
'hadoop jar migrate_mp3_to_wav_hadoop-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
<input/mp3list.txt> <output/mp3-to-wav-output-dir>'
where <mp3list.txt> is the path (on hdfs) to the text file with the list of mp3 file paths (on hdfs),
and <output/mp3-to-wav-output-dir> is the output directory for the migration and qa results
as well as the map-reduce result (on hdfs).

PERMISSIONS
Note that the map-reduce results are written by the user that invoked the map-reduce job with this users permission.
The commands run and the results written within the map job are run and written by a different "map-red user"
with this users permission. At SBs platform this user has fewer permissions. The <output/mp3-to-wav-output-dir>
must have write permissions for both users!!!

At SB we are right now using
"/net/zone1.isilon.sblokalnet/ifs/data/hdfs/user/scape/mapred-write/test-output/MigrateMp3ToWav/"
