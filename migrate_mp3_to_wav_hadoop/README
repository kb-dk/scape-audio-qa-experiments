The migrate-mp3-to-wav-hadoop module creates two hadoop jobs. The first job MigrateMp3ToWav, which does the
actual migration and the ffprobe characterisation of the mp3 files.

The input to the job is a list of mp3 file paths to mp3 files already available on HDFS. The text file with
the list of mp3 file paths should also be available on HDFS.

To run the job first run 'mvn package' to get 'migrate_mp3_to_wav_hadoop-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar'

Then run
'hadoop jar migrate_mp3_to_wav_hadoop-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
<input/mp3list.txt> <output/map-reduce-result-output-dir> <output/mp3-to-wav-output-dir>'
where <mp3list.txt> is the path (on hdfs) to the text file with the list of mp3 file paths (on hdfs),
<output/map-reduce-result-output-dir> is the output directory for the map-reduce result (on hdfs)
and <output/mp3-to-wav-output-dir> is the output directory for the migration and qa results (on hdfs).

The reason for two output directories is that the map-reduce results are written by the user that
invoked the map-reduce job with this users permission. This user creates the <output/map-reduce-result-output-dir>
output directory with very restricted permissions.

The commands run and the results written within the map job are run and written by a different "map-red user"
with this users permission. At SBs platform this user does not have permission to write to the output directory
just created. We therefore add a second output directory, where this user has permissions to write!

The better solution may be just one output directory with write permissions for both users!!! We will look into the
possibility of changing permissions on the created output directory.

At SB we currently use this directory as the second (and primary) output directory
"/net/zone1.isilon.sblokalnet/ifs/data/hdfs/user/scape/mapred-write/test-output/MigrateMp3ToWav/"
