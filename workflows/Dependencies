These workflows depend on

taverna (obviously)
migrationQA (later changed to waveform-compare) from scape-xcorrsound
ffmpeg >= 0.10
mpeg321
jhove2.sh

This means that these commands must be available and functions from the $PATH
ffmpeg
ffprobe
mpeg321
jhove2.sh
migrationQA
executeWorkflow.sh

$PATH can be updated in setenv.sh

checkinstall.sh checks if the required tools are installed.

migrateMP3ToWAV.sh <input-file-list> <output-dir> uses the
migrateValidateCompare_iapetus_listToList_largeScaleTest_V2.t2flow workflow (to be renamed)
to test migration and qa of the files in input-file-list.

Output is written to output-dir, but the wav files are deleted as the workflow is used
in large-scale testing, and the wav files are large indeed.
