These workflows depend on

taverna (obviously)
migrationQA (later changed to waveform-compare) from scape-xcorrsound
ffmpeg >= 0.10
mpeg321
jhove2.sh

This means that these commands must be available and functions from the $PATH
ffmpeg
ffprobe
mpeg321
jhove2.sh
migrationQA
executeWorkflow.sh

$PATH can be updated in setenv.sh

Note the jhove2 "not in install dir fix script" expects jhove2 to be installed in $HOME/tools/jhove2-2.0.0

checkinstall.sh checks if the required tools are installed.

migrateMP3ToWAV.sh <input-file-list> <output-dir> uses the
/src/main/taverna/Mp3toWav_migrateValidateCompareCompare.t2flow workflow
to migrate and qa the files in <input-file-list>.

The WAV output files and the qa result summary are written to <output-dir>.
The detailed results and logs are written to <output-dir>/logs.
